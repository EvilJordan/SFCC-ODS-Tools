# SFCC-ODS-Tools

My set of homegrown tools to make dealing with ODSes easier keeps expanding, so I've started breaking them out into their own `.md`s

- [setupAutomation.md](setupAutomation.md): Process for helping automate sandbox setup
- [loginAudit.md](loginAudit.md): BASH one-liner for pulling recent login information for a box from Securitylogs
- [catalogAge.js](catalogAge.js): Determine how old catalogs are on the sandbox and delete the box if non-existent
- [deleteSandbox.js](deleteSandbox.js): Delete a sandbox if its code hasn't been touched in X days
- [deleteUsers.js](deleteUsers.js): Delete (purge) any users from Account Manager that are in DELETED or INITIAL status
