# SFCC-ODS-Tools

My set of homegrown tools to make dealing with ODSes easier keeps expanding, so I've started breaking them out into their own `.md`s

- [setupAutomation.md](setupAutomation.md): Process for helping automate sandbox setup
- [loginAudit.md](loginAudit.md): BASH one-liner for pulling recent login information for a box from Securitylogs
